# Networking
It is a very broad topic. As I'll try and list the follow networking topics I do understand. 

# Network topologies
I would say this is one of the easiest things to remember once studied, such as bus, hybrid, mesh, ring, and star topologies, and knowing each security and weaknesses is important, these major topologies are easy to understand and common in different scenarios. Not going into detail of each, but they all have common and differences. Overall I'm fairly confident on network topologies.

# Networking communications 
Is another system which is more complex, since it talks about how data is sent, received, encrypted, etc. At my current knowledge level, I learned that OSI and TCP/IP models are the main frameworks. With the Open Systems Interconnection being 7 layers being-

Physical

Data Link

Network

Transport

Session

Presentation

Application

Each with deeper usage, thatâ€™s another topic for later.

The TCP/IP model is four layers instead of 7, and a set of protocols that determines how data is transmitted and received across the internet and other networks. Its layers-

Application

Transport

Internet

Link 

Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol is simple, uses protocols, flexible and scalable for mass large scale protocols and technologies. And allows guaranteed data delivery without it being corrupted.

# Network security
Security protects a network's infrastructure and data from unauthorized access, misuse, or theft, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability for users and devices. An important part includes firewalls to control traffic, antivirus/anti-malware software to fight malicious software, and network access control (NAC) to manage device access. Implementing network segmentation, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) are also essential practices for a robust network security strategy. Cybercrimals will try to bypass, hack, or use other unauthorized means of access to the network (including data aka data breaches). Network security overall is important since it protects your information from being stolen and sold.
