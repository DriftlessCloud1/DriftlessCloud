# Networking
Is very broad topic. As I'll try and list the follow netowkring topcis I do understand. 

# Network topologies
I would say this is one of the easiest things to remember once studied, such as bus, hybrid, mesh, ring, and star topologies, and know each security and weaknesses is important, these major topologies are easy to understand and common in different scenarios. Not going into detail of each, but they all have common and differences. Overall I'm fairly confident on network topologies.

# Networking communications 
Is another system which is more complex, since it talks about how data is sent, received, encrypted, etc. At my current knowledge level, I learned that OSI and TCP/IP models are the main frameworks. With the Open Systems Interconnection being 7 layers being-

Physical

Data Link

Network

Transport

Session

Presentation

Application

Each with deeper usage, thatâ€™s another topic for later.

The TCP/IP model is four layers instead of 7, and a set of protocols that determines how data is transmitted and received across the internet and other networks. Its layers-

Application

Transport

Internet

Link 

Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol is simple, uses protocols, flexible and scalable for mass large scale protocols and technologies. And allows guaranteed data delivery without it beiang corrupted.
