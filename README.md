In this branch you'll find all my custom tools that I made for myself, whether or not they are better or more efficient than publicly available regular tools would be up to a cyber security expert. Otherwise if it's listed here, it works. Regardless, making custom tools for cyber security allows me to understand deeper its functions, customize exactly how I like it, and perhaps be more efficient in my work.
