Room completions aren't really CTFs or certifications (can be CTFs but CTFs in the CTFs branch will be dedicated to CTFs, not necessarily walkthroughs), but being able to prove to people that I did complete a path helps for myself and notes. You can view the completed Path completions above. Note- The first dozen of rooms I started out with aren't logged here since they are beginner rooms, and it would take too much time to catch up and log them, Iâ€™ll log anything from 8/26/2025 and newer.
