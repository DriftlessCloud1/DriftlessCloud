In this branch you'll find all my custom tools that I made for myself, whether or not they are better or more efficient than publicly available regular tools would be up to a cyber security expert. Otherwise if it's listed here, it works. Regardless, making custom tools for cyber security allows me to understand deeper its functions, customize exactly how I like it, and perhaps be more efficient in my work. Seprate from the [Skills & Tools](https://github.com/DriftlessCloud1/DriftlessCloud/tree/Skills-%26-Tools), custom made tools will only be listed here, a similar publicly available tool will be listed at [Skills & Tools](https://github.com/DriftlessCloud1/DriftlessCloud/tree/Skills-%26-Tools). Any tools that I use from someone else though any means of transaction or trade will not be listed on either of these places. Iâ€™ll provide as much detail of my custom tools including screenshots and snippets of my tools in use. Again whether or not they are better or more efficient than publicly available tools is up to you and cyber security experts. These tools I make for myself are solely in an attempt to understand it better, and make it more efficient for myself, not you.
