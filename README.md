This is an ambitious but achievable goal, and it's great that you're starting early in your career. The key, especially with a busy schedule, is to be focused, consistent, and smart about your learning. You're right to want a month-by-month roadmap. Let's break down a potential plan for your cybersecurity journey, from the fundamentals to getting your first paid gig, with a focus on ethical hacking, pentesting, and bug hunting.

### **The Core Philosophy**

Before the roadmap, understand this: Cybersecurity is about a deep understanding of how things work so you can find where they break. Your IT support specialist degree is a perfect foundation. The networking, operating systems, and basic IT troubleshooting you're learning are the building blocks of cybersecurity. Don't dismiss them; they are the most critical part of this entire process.

Your roadmap will focus on three key pillars:
1.  **Foundational Knowledge:** Building a rock-solid understanding of networking, operating systems, and basic security concepts.
2.  **Practical Application:** Getting hands-on experience through platforms like TryHackMe, CTFs, and personal projects.
3.  **Professional Development:** Building a portfolio, networking, and preparing for your career.

### **The Month-by-Month Roadmap**

This is a general guide. Adjust the pace based on your college workload. The goal is consistent progress, not a race.

#### **Month 1: The Foundation & TryHackMe Start**

* **Study:**
    * **Networking Fundamentals:** This is non-negotiable. Learn TCP/IP, the OSI model, DNS, DHCP, HTTP, and how routers and switches work. Use resources like Professor Messer's CompTIA Network+ videos (free on YouTube).
    * **Linux Mastery:** Since you have Kali, start using it as your primary learning environment. Get comfortable with the command line (Bash). Learn file systems, permissions, and basic commands.
* **Do:**
    * **TryHackMe:** This is your primary resource. Do the "Pre-Security" learning path. This will cover the absolute basics you need to know. It's interactive, beginner-friendly, and perfect for building muscle memory.
    * **Create a Blog/Portfolio:** Start a blog (e.g., on Medium or a simple website) or a GitHub repository. Your first post should be "My Cybersecurity Journey Begins" or something similar. Document your learning, challenges you've solved, and tools you're learning about.
* **Resources:**
    * **TryHackMe:** "Pre-Security" and "Linux Fundamentals" paths.
    * **YouTube:** Professor Messer's Network+ series, and The Cyber Mentor's beginner hacking series.

#### **Month 2: Deeper Dive into Networking & Tools**

* **Study:**
    * **More Networking:** Dive deeper into protocols. Learn about subnets, ports, and common network services.
    * **Introduction to Hacking Concepts:** Begin to learn about the phases of a penetration test: reconnaissance, scanning, gaining access, maintaining access, and covering tracks. This provides a mental model for all your future work.
* **Do:**
    * **TryHackMe:** Complete the "Network Fundamentals" and "Introductory Networking" paths.
    * **Tool Practice:** Start using basic tools included in Kali. Learn **Nmap** (Network Mapper) by doing the "Nmap" room on TryHackMe. Learn to use it for host discovery and port scanning. Learn **Wireshark** for packet analysis.
    * **Document:** Write a blog post or GitHub entry about your experience with Nmap or Wireshark. Explain what you learned and how you used the tool.
* **Resources:**
    * **TryHackMe:** "Nmap" room, "Wireshark" room.
    * **Kali Linux:** Practice with Nmap on your own network (with permission, of course) or on the machines provided by TryHackMe.

#### **Month 3: Web Hacking & CTFs**

* **Study:**
    * **Web Technologies:** Learn how the web works. Understand HTTP/HTTPS, DNS, and basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript. This is crucial for web pentesting and bug hunting.
    * **Vulnerability Types:** Start researching common web vulnerabilities like SQL Injection (SQLi) and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Don't just read about them; understand *why* they happen.
* **Do:**
    * **TryHackMe:** Complete the "Web Fundamentals" and "OWASP Top 10" paths. The OWASP Juice Shop is an excellent, free, and intentionally vulnerable web application to practice on.
    * **Your First CTF:** CTFs (Capture The Flag) are competitions where you solve challenges to find "flags" (secret strings). Participate in a beginner-friendly Jeopardy-style CTF. TryHackMe and Hack The Box have CTFs. Look on CTFtime.org for upcoming competitions.
    * **Log It:** This is where logging is key. In a notebook or digital document, log the CTF you played, the challenges you attempted, the tools you used, and the flags you found. If you get stuck, log that, too.
* **Resources:**
    * **TryHackMe:** "OWASP Top 10," "OWASP Juice Shop" rooms.
    * **PortSwigger's Web Security Academy:** Free, well-structured labs on web vulnerabilities.

#### **Month 4: Bug Hunting & Privilege Escalation**

* **Study:**
    * **Bug Bounty Methodology:** Learn about how bug bounty programs work. Understand the concepts of scope, vulnerability severity, and responsible disclosure.
    * **Privilege Escalation:** Learn techniques to escalate privileges on a compromised system. This is a crucial skill for both pentesting and CTFs.
* **Do:**
    * **TryHackMe/Hack The Box:** Focus on rooms that specifically teach privilege escalation for both Windows and Linux.
    * **Create Your Own Lab:** Set up a vulnerable virtual machine on VirtualBox (e.g., Metasploitable 2 or 3) and practice the techniques you've learned in a controlled environment.
    * **Your First Bug Bounty Attempt:** Sign up for a bug bounty platform like HackerOne or Bugcrowd. Start with "VDP" (Vulnerability Disclosure Programs) that don't offer payment, but will get you used to the process of finding and reporting a vulnerability.
* **Resources:**
    * **TryHackMe:** Look for rooms with "Privilege Escalation" in the title.
    * **HackerOne/Bugcrowd:** Read their "getting started" guides. Follow some of the top bug hunters on Twitter/X or YouTube for insights (e.g., The Cyber Mentor, LiveOverflow, STÖK).

#### **Month 5-6: Job & Career Prep**

* **Study:**
    * **Certifications:** Start looking at certifications. CompTIA Security+ is an excellent entry-level cert that will solidify your foundational knowledge. You don't have to take it right away, but start learning the material.
    * **Resume/CV Building:** Tailor your resume. Highlight your IT support experience, but add a new "Cybersecurity Skills" section. List the platforms you've used (TryHackMe, Hack The Box), the tools you know (Nmap, Wireshark, Burp Suite), and the concepts you understand (e.g., SQLi, XSS, privilege escalation).
* **Do:**
    * **Networking:** Use LinkedIn to connect with cybersecurity professionals. Join local or online cybersecurity communities. Go to meetups or conferences if you can.
    * **Resume/Portfolio:** Revamp your portfolio. This is your chance to show, not just tell, a potential employer what you can do. Include links to your solved CTFs, your bug bounty reports (if allowed), and any personal projects.
    * **Apply for Internships:** Start looking for internships. Even an IT internship that's security-focused is a great stepping stone. Use your college's career center, LinkedIn, and platforms like Handshake.
* **Resources:**
    * **CompTIA Security+ Study Guides:** Professor Messer videos, Dion Training on Udemy.
    * **LinkedIn:** Optimize your profile and start connecting.

### **Advice & Caveats**

* **Balance:** You are in college. School comes first. The roadmap is a guide, not a strict deadline. Don't sacrifice your grades.
* **Quit Your Job:** Do not quit your job until you have a paid internship or a clear, documented path to income. Bug bounties are not a reliable source of income for beginners. You need to build skills and credibility first. An IT support job is valuable experience, and you're learning the fundamentals of the systems you'll be hacking later.
* **Stay Legal:** Always operate within the legal and ethical boundaries. Only perform activities on systems you have explicit permission to test (like the ones on TryHackMe, Hack The Box, or official bug bounty programs).
* **Don't Get Overwhelmed:** There's an endless amount to learn. Focus on the core fundamentals and hands-on practice. The rest will follow. You're on the right track.

### Cybersecurity Roadmap: From Beginner to Job-Ready in 12 Months

Based on your setup (Kali Linux in VirtualBox, TOR, Windows 11) and situation (college for IT support, wanting to shift to cybersecurity like pentesting and bug hunting, while balancing school/work), this roadmap is tailored for you as a beginner. It starts slow to build foundations without overwhelming you, assuming 10-15 hours/week (fitting around college and work). Focus on free/affordable resources, hands-on practice via TryHackMe (THM) as you mentioned, CTFs, and logging progress (e.g., via a free GitHub repo or Notion page for writeups—document every lab/CTF with screenshots, steps, and learnings to build a portfolio).

**General Tips Before Starting:**
- **Time Management:** Dedicate specific days (e.g., weekends for hands-on, weekdays for theory). Use apps like Forest or Pomodoro for focus. Since you're struggling to remember, review notes daily and teach concepts to an imaginary friend.
- **Setup Enhancements:** Customize Kali lightly—install tools like Burp Suite Community (free) via `sudo apt update && sudo apt install burpsuite`. Practice Linux commands in Kali daily.
- **Quitting Job/Next Steps:** Don't quit immediately; build 3-6 months of skills first. Then apply for internships via your college career center, LinkedIn, Indeed, or sites like CISA/NSA programs. For self-employment (bug bounties), aim for Month 7+ after CTF experience—start on platforms like HackerOne with beginner programs. Remote jobs are common in cybersec; target entry-level like SOC analyst or junior pentester.
- **Certifications:** Aim for free/cheap ones like Google Cybersecurity Certificate (free on Coursera) early, then CompTIA Security+ (~$350 exam, free study via Professor Messer YouTube).
- **Community:** Join free Discord/Reddit (r/cybersecurity, r/netsec) for support. Track progress weekly.

Good luck—you've got a solid start with your Kali setup! If you need tweaks, ask.
deepseek
Of course. This is an excellent goal, and you're in a fantastic position to start. Being 18, in college, and already thinking about this path puts you years ahead of many professionals. Let's build a structured, month-by-month roadmap that respects your time constraints with school and work.

### Guiding Philosophy for Your Journey

1.  **Quality over Quantity:** It's better to fully understand one concept than to skim ten. With your busy schedule, focused, consistent effort is key.
2.  **Build in Public:** Document your journey. Use a blog, GitHub, or LinkedIn. This creates a portfolio that is more valuable than any degree to many employers.
3.  **Hands-On is Everything:** You learn cybersecurity by *doing*. Labs, CTFs, and projects are your primary teachers.
4.  **It's a Marathon, Not a Sprint:** Burnout is real. Aim for consistent, manageable progress.

### Addressing Your Specific Questions

*   **Quitting Your Job:** **Do not quit your job until you have an internship or another source of income secured.** The market is competitive. Use the income from your current job to fund any certifications (Security+ ~$400, eJPT ~$200).
*   **Self-Employed Bug Hunting:** This is a viable goal, but **extremely difficult to start with**. Most successful bug hunters have years of experience. Treat it as a **side hustle until it consistently makes money**. Your first $1000 bounty could take 6 months of dedicated work.
*   **Resources:**
    *   **Primary Learning:** **TryHackMe** ($10/mo subscription is 100% worth it), **PortSwigger Web Security Academy** (Free), **HackTheBox** (~$15/mo, wait until you're ready).
    *   **Certifications:** **CompTIA Security+** (Foundation), **eJPT** (Practical Entry-Level Pentest).
    *   **Community:** **Twitter**, **Reddit (r/cybersecurity, r/netsecstudents)**, **Discord servers**.
*   **Focus:** Your problem is common. **Schedule your time.** For example: "Sunday 2pm-5pm: TryHackMe. Tuesday/Thursday 7pm-9pm: Study Networking." Protecting this time is crucial. Use tools like **Forest** or **Cold Turkey** to block distractions during these periods.

You have the drive and the setup. Now you need the structure and consistency. Follow this roadmap, focus on the fundamentals, and you will build the skills to land a role in cybersecurity. Good luck
