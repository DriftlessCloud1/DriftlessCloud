In this branch you'll find all my custom tools that I made for myself, whether or not they are better or more efficient than publicly available regular tools would be up to a cyber security expert. Otherwise if it's listed here, it works. Regardless, making custom tools for cyber security allows me to understand deeper its functions, customize exactly how I like it, and perhaps be more efficient in my work. Seprate from the [Skills & Tools](https://github.com/DriftlessCloud1/DriftlessCloud/tree/Skills-%26-Tools), custom made tools will only be listed here, a similar publicly available tool will be listed at [Skills & Tools](https://github.com/DriftlessCloud1/DriftlessCloud/tree/Skills-%26-Tools). Any scripts that I either get from someone else though any type of transaction or trade will not be listed on either of these places. I’ll provide as much detail of my custom tools, but you’ll have to make your own since this person with one brain cell already did.
