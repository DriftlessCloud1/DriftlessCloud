# DriftlessCloud's cyber security profile
Hello! I'm DriftlessCloud, I'm interested in becoming a ethical hacker and pentester. Currently I'm studying IT support for a associate's degree, I like exploring security challenges, solving CTFs, and learning security techniques. I'm currently learning about futher cyber security tools and skills. Anything I learn, recive, and complete will be listed here for personal benefit as well as a place for companies to view my proven skills.

To get started and look around, click the "main" icon and find a catagory that you're wishing to look at. All categories are updated weekly, as of right now, they may be fairly empty due to the brand new start into cyber security learning and practice. All proofs are in ".md" files, click on one and the provided infomation is available.

*(Regarding proofs for contracted pentests, if you find private infomation that might've been passed through and publicly on a pentest .md file for proof, please message me ASAP so I can remove that part, I'll be as careful to upload as much proof proof of a pentest result while keeping you're infomation private).*
