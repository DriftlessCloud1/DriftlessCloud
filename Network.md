Networking is very broad topic. As I'll try and list the follow netowkring topcis I do understand. 

Network topologies. I would say this is one of the easiest things to remember once studied, such as bus, hybrid, mesh, ring, and star topologies, and know each security and weaknesses is important, these major topologies are easy to understand and common in different scenarios. Not going into detail of each, but they all have common and differences. Overall I'm fairly confident on network topologies.
