- **Current Situation**: 18 years old, in college studying IT with a desire to transition into cybersecurity focused on penetration testing, bug hunting, and ethical hacking.
- **Resources Available**: Kali Linux in VirtualBox, TOR browser, Windows 11 as the main PC, and self-motivated learning approach.
- **Goals**: Full-time role in cybersecurity or freelance work; aim to establish a strong foundation in ethical hacking and get hands-on experience through CTFs and bug hunting.
- **Challenges**: Balancing college coursework, part-time job, and learning. Needs structured approach and resources to follow.
- **Proposed Roadmap**: A month-by-month plan focusing on foundational knowledge, practical applications, and professional development to lead to employment or freelance opportunities in cybersecurity.

### Phase 1: Foundation Building (Months 1-3)
- **Month 1**: Set up a learning environment. Focus on networking fundamentals (TCP/IP, OSI model, HTTP) using resources like Professor Messer's Network+ videos and TryHackMe's “Pre-Security” path.
- **Month 2**: Deepen knowledge of Linux commands and start learning about web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript); complete TryHackMe 'Linux Fundamentals' and 'Web Fundamentals.'
- **Month 3**: Introduction to hacking tools; complete TryHackMe rooms focused on enumeration, Nmap, and basic vulnerability assessments.

### Phase 2: Skill Building and Certification Prep (Months 4-6)
- **Month 4**: Study the stages of penetration testing (reconnaissance, scanning, exploitation) and practice with tools like Burp Suite; complete TryHackMe “Offensive Pentesting” path.
- **Month 5**: Deep dive into web application vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10) and establish a personal portfolio website documenting experiences.
- **Month 6**: Prepare for entry-level certifications (CompTIA Security+) and start applying for internships in cybersecurity.

### Phase 3: Job Hunting and Real-World Practice (Months 7-12)
- **Month 7**: Research bug bounty programs and learn about reporting vulnerabilities; aim to submit initial reports.
- **Month 8**: Practice on intermediate CTFs and enhance knowledge in incident response.
- **Month 9**: Update resume emphasizing hands-on labs, CTF participation, and relevant skills; apply for cybersecurity internships and junior roles.
- **Month 10-12**: Focus on networking within the cybersecurity community, participate in meetups, and prepare for technical interviews while applying extensively to entry-level positions.

### Ongoing Development
- Engage in continuous learning; document every step on platforms like GitHub; participate in communities for support and sharing experiences.
- Prioritize legal and ethical considerations in all cybersecurity activities.
- Set monthly goals and review progress regularly to adapt to evolving interests or challenges.

### Final Tips
- Stay organized; manage time effectively around college and job commitments; seek mentorship and network actively.
- Remain flexible with the roadmap to ensure it fits personal learning pace and lifestyle changes.
- Celebrate milestones to maintain motivation throughout the journey towards a fulfilling career in cybersecurity.
