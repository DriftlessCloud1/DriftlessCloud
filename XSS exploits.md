# XSS exploits
Learning about XSS exploits.

- Types of XSS Exploits:
- **Stored XSS**: Most dangerous; injected scripts are stored on the server (e.g., databases, comments). Executes when users access the page.
- **Reflected XSS**: Scripts reflected from the server, often via error messages or search results. Requires tricking users into clicking a malicious link.
- **DOM-based XSS**: Occurs within the victim's browser, modifying the DOM. Relies on vulnerabilities in client-side code without server reflection.

- Ethical Hacking Process for Testing XSS:
- **Step 1: Reconnaissance** üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
- Gather information about the target app.
- Identify entry points for user data submission (e.g., search forms, comment sections).

- **Step 2: Payload Injection**
- Begin injecting payloads at identified entry points.
- Use simple payloads to test for vulnerabilities, such as ``.

- **Step 3: Evading Filters**
- Use advanced techniques to bypass web application filters:
- **HTML attribute injection**: E.g., ``.
- **Case manipulation**: E.g., ``.

- Prevention and Mitigation:
- Sanitize and validate user input by escaping special characters to avoid code injection.
- Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict script sources.
- Focus on improving security; adhere to ethical hacking guidelines and responsibilities.
